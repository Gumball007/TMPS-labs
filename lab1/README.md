# Lab description

Write a program which will illustrate at least 2 **SOLID** Principles

## SOLID Principles

The **SOLID** Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.

**S**ingle Responsibility Principle. A class should have only one job. So if a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled.

**O**pen-closed Principle. Software entities(Classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, not modification.

**L**iskov Substitution Principle. The clients are completely isolated and unaware of changes in the class hierarchy. In simpler terms means that a subclass, child or specialization of an object or class must be suitable by its Parent or SuperClass.

**I**nterface Segregation Principle. Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

**D**ependecy Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions. To create specific behavior you can use techniques like inheritance or interfaces.
