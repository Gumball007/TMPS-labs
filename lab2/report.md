## Objectives

__1. Study and understand the Creational Design Patterns.__

__2. Choose a domain, define its main classes/models/entities and choose the appropriate instantiation mechanisms.__

__3. Use some creational design patterns for object instantiation in a sample project.__

## Theory

In software engineering, the creational design patterns are the general solutions that deal with object creation, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by optimizing, hiding or controlling the object creation.

Some examples of this kind of design patterns are:

* Singleton
* Builder
* Prototype
* Object Pooling
* Factory Method
* Abstract Factory

## Implementation description

I implemented Singleton, Builder, Factory patterns in Python. I used functions and structured the code as it needed.

### Singleton Pattern

__Singleton__ is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

```python


```

</br>

### Builder Pattern

__Builder__ is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

```python

```

</br>

### Factory Pattern

__Factory Method__ is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

```python

```

## Conclusions

At this laboratoty work I found out about stream and block ciphers. From all of them , I choose to implement Rivest Cipher and Data Encryption Standart Cipher.
